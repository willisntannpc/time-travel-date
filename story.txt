As I endured the accelerating timeline, the roar of the machine shaking every cell in my body,
I couldn’t let a sense of panic wash over me in theory, this machine managed to shoot the
curtain of time, and it allowed me to so cross the vast expanse of human history in the blink
of an eye ? What if I was in the past, lost forever in the history of time? Questions swirled
through my mind, but I pushed them aside, my heart pounding with joy. I was about to embark o
n the journey of a lifetime, and nothing was going to stop me.
I stepped out of the accelerator, enveloped in the warm rays of the ancient Egyptian sun.
The thick air echoes through the streets with the smell of incense and fresh bread, the
sound of hammering on stones. I walked into the bustling market, attracted by the vibrant 
colors and exotic smells. People in formal clothes rushed past me, their faces a reflection 
of tasks and purpose. I made my way to the Great Pyramid, its towering form looming over me 
like a giant guard. As I reached out to touch the stone I felt a connection to the people 
who created this marvel, their sweat and hard work carved into everything I wandered into 
the church, except for the incredible calligraphy the strange lines that tell the story 
of a civilization over and over again, but it's still alive in my mind
